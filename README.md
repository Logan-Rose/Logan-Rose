- 👋 Hi, I’m Logan!
- 💻 I’m currently in my final semester at uOttawa and working as a Software Developer Consultant at [Coveo](https://www.coveo.com/en).
- ✏️ This semester I am working on my [Undergraduate Honours Project](https://github.com/Logan-Rose/CSI4900), focusing on multi task learning with imbalance.
- 👨‍🏫 I am currently working as a Teaching Assistant for SEG2105: Introduction to Software Engineering, helping students learn android app development and the core principles of software development.
- 💥 I have been having lots of fun (...and procrastinating my school work by) working on [Tailor](https://github.com/Logan-Rose/tailor), a modular resume builder.
- 📫 If you would like to work together, send me an email at logan.rose0329@gmail.com or connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-rose/)!
