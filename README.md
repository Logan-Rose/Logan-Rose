- 👋 Hi, I’m Logan Rose
- 🌱 I’m a fourth year student at uOttawa
- 💻 I am currently completing a COOP Work term at [Coveo](https://www.coveo.com/en)
- This past semester I built a [Data Mart](https://github.com/Logan-Rose/world-bank-data-mart) using data from the world bank, and an [American Sign Language Transcriber](https://github.com/Logan-Rose/ASL-transcriber) using OpenCv and Tensorflow.
- ✏️ Recently I have been working on improving my understanding of commonly used data structures and algorithms by completing [daily coding problems](https://github.com/Logan-Rose/daily-programming-practice)
- 💥 Over the past few months, I have been having lots of fun (...and procrastinating my school work by) working on [My Jeopardy Game](https://github.com/Logan-Rose/jeopardy-game)
- 📫 Send me an email at logan.rose0329@gmail.com or connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-rose/)
